# Decaf Compiler with Lark
This project is a minimal Decaf compiler to MIPS using Lark library. we use Lark to make and traverse pars tree with our grammar.
In this project, we implement single Inheritance and polymorphisme. all of class field accesses are protected. Also note that we don't support Error Handling for now!

Decaf is a language very similar to Java but much more simpler. You can see language description in LangDsc.pdf in the docs folder. 

Feel free to contribute to this project ;).
